We have developed an online portal for users to file FIRs/complaints on a blockchain network. The portal includes a login system that is integrated with Computer Vision to verify the user's face. This has been implemented to prevent robot or illegitimate FIR registrations. Once logged in, users can file complaints, which are then saved on an Ethereum smart contract and populated on a Polygon blockchain network.

## Current Problems with FIR Registration System:

- **Delayed Registration:** The current system often leads to delays in registering FIRs, which can compromise the investigation process and allow the criminals to get away with the crime.
- **Lack of Transparency**: The traditional FIR registration system lacks transparency, which can lead to corruption and misuse of power.
- **Inefficient Record Keeping**: The current system relies on manual record keeping, which can lead to loss of data, human error, and difficulties in retrieving information.
- **Security Threats**: The current system is vulnerable to security threats such as hacking, data breaches, and cyber attacks.

## How Your Solution is Solving These Problems:

- **Faster Registration**: Your online portal using blockchain technology allows for faster registration of FIRs, which can help speed up the investigation process and bring criminals to justice more quickly.
- **Increased Transparency**: Your portal provides greater transparency in the FIR registration process by allowing users to track the progress of their complaint and providing a secure and tamper-proof record of all complaints filed.
- **Efficient Record Keeping**: Your solution uses blockchain technology to create a secure and efficient system for record-keeping, reducing the likelihood of human error and ensuring that data is easily accessible.
- **Enhanced Security**: Your solution uses blockchain technology, which provides an enhanced level of security against threats such as hacking, data breaches, and cyber attacks.
- **Women Safety**: Women who are suffering from domestic voilence can reach out on our potal as their pre reporting of incident.

## Challenges we ran into?

- **Developing a user-friendly interface**: One of the main challenges in building an online portal like this is creating a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and understand for all users, regardless of their technical expertise.
- **Integrating blockchain technology**: Implementing blockchain technology can be complex and requires expertise in coding and smart contract development. Ensuring the security and integrity of the blockchain network can also be a challenge.
- **Ensuring data privacy**: Storing sensitive personal information and FIR details on a blockchain network requires strict adherence to data privacy regulations and best practices to protect users' data.
- **Integrating facial recognition technology**: Developing and integrating facial recognition technology requires expertise in computer vision and deep learning algorithms. Ensuring that the system is accurate, reliable, and secure can be a challenge.
**Ensuring compatibility with existing systems**: Integrating the new FIR registration system with existing law enforcement databases and processes can be a challenge, especially if there are differences in data formats and protocols.
